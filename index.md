## About
I am an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa AI in Cambridge, MA. Previously, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Northeastern University, where I conducted natural language processing and computational social science research with [David Smith](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/). During my undergrad, I studied Computer Science and Greek and Roman Studies at Rhodes College and conducted Virtual Environment research with [Betsy Sanders](https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/sandersb).
